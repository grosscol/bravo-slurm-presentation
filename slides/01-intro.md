### Yak Shaving

##
- **Yak shaving** refers to a series of tangential tasks that need to be performed before a project can progress. 

- Attributed to Carlin Vieri and inspired by an episode of The Ren & Stimpy Show. 

- The term's name alludes to the seemingly random and tangential nature of the tasks being performed, even though they may be necessary to solve a larger problem.
